# Trot — Session log

A lightweight "where are we" file. Read this when resuming work after a break. Update at the end of each substantive session.

**Format:** newest entry at the top. Each entry covers what was done, what was committed, what's next, and any blockers. Older entries (10+ sessions back) get compressed to a single line.

**This file is not auto-loaded into CLAUDE.md context** — it's read on demand to keep daily context costs low.

## 2026-05-06 — Multi-dog UX + breed-table-driven targets

**Done this session:**
- **Multi-dog UX.** New `AppState` (`@Observable` class) holds the selected `PersistentIdentifier` and is injected via `.environment(appState)`. Home, Activity, and Profile all read the selected dog from AppState, so switching propagates everywhere. Header gained a dropdown switcher menu (with checkmarks + "Add another dog" entry). DogProfileView gained an "Add another dog" button presenting AddDogView as a sheet. AddDogView gained `showsCancelButton: Bool = false` for the sheet case and now writes the saved dog into AppState on new-dog flows. Archive clears `selectedDogID` so AppState falls back to the next active dog (or routes to AddDogView if none). 4 new `AppStateTests`.
- **ExerciseTargetService + BreedData.json.** Subagent extracted 30 breed YAML blocks from `docs/breed-table.md` into `ios/Trot/Trot/Resources/BreedData.json` (canonical schema: breed, aliases, size, defaultIntensity, lifeStages, plus size-fallback table, senior-age-by-size thresholds, and three condition adjustments). New `ExerciseTargetService` is a pure-function namespace that picks a daily target from breed + DOB + weight + health flags. Strategy: breed lookup by name or alias (case- and punctuation-insensitive), size fallback for unknown breeds (weight bins), life-stage selection (puppy <1yr, senior at size-specific threshold), conservative-low for puppy/senior + midpoint for adult per breed-table rules, then largest-single-reduction for combined health conditions (no multiplicative stacking — too aggressive), rounded to nearest 5 min. AddDogFormState now writes this on both new-dog save and edit, replacing the hardcoded `60`. 12 new `ExerciseTargetServiceTests`. Existing AddDogFormState tests updated to assert wire-up via `state.computedDailyTargetMinutes` rather than hardcoded numbers — JSON values can evolve without churning these tests.
- **Test count: 55 passing, all serial** (`-parallel-testing-enabled NO`): 8 AddDogFormState, 7 LogWalkFormState, 13 StreakService, 12 NotificationDecisions, 4 AppState, 12 ExerciseTargetService.

**Committed this session:**
- `0c1d9e1` — Add multi-dog selection with switcher menu and add-another-dog flow
- `dca2805` — Add ExerciseTargetService backed by 30-breed BreedData.json
- Both pushed to `ElimDroflem/trot`.

**Next session pickup:**
- **Vercel Edge Function for the LLM proxy.** Write `web/api/exercise-plan.ts` (TypeScript, Anthropic Haiku 4.5, 8s timeout, anonymous-install-token rate limiting). No deploy until Corey decides — code-only, validated locally. iOS LLMService wires later to overlay personalisation on top of ExerciseTargetService.
- After that: missing-screens polish (Insights, weekly recap UI, streak milestone celebration), then end-of-build (paid program, real auth, CloudKit turn-on, HealthKitService + walk detection).

**Open from this session that may surface later:**
- DEBUG-seeded Luna's `dailyTargetMinutes` is still the hardcoded 60 from when she was first inserted. Existing dogs aren't recomputed on relaunch (deliberate — edits trigger recomputation, seed data is DEBUG-only). If the seeded value bothers anyone in dev, edit Luna once via DogProfileView to recompute. Not a real-user concern.
- Recompute-on-edit is unconditional. If a future "manual override target" UI lands, the apply() flow will need to skip recomputation when the user has explicitly overridden. Not a v1 concern.
- Mixed-breed UI still single-breed only — `BreedData.json` has aliases but no two-breed weighted average. v1.1 candidate per `decisions.md`.

## 2026-05-05 (late evening) — Daily loop functional end-to-end

**Done this session:**
- **SwiftData schema** built CloudKit-ready under `ios/Trot/Trot/Core/Models/`. Three @Model classes (`Dog`, `Walk`, `WalkWindow`), four raw-value enums in `Enums/ModelEnums.swift`, `TrotSchemaV1` + empty `TrotMigrationPlan` in `Schema/`. Every property has a default or is optional; relationships are optional collections; `.nullify` on the many-to-many `Walk.dogs` relationship; no `@Attribute(.unique)`. The single line that flips local→CloudKit at end of build is marked in `TrotApp.swift`. `DebugSeed` populates Luna + sample 42-min walk on first DEBUG launch when the store is empty. `HomeView` now reads from `@Query` instead of hardcoded constants. Plan-mode session backed this; full plan at `~/.claude/plans/melodic-tickling-blum.md`.
- **Add-a-dog onboarding form** at `Features/Onboarding/AddDogView.swift`. Brand-styled custom form (not native Form) with photo picker, name, breed, DOB, weight, sex, neutered, activity level, three health tickboxes + free-text notes. `AddDogFormState` is a plain struct → unit-testable. `UIImage+Downscale` extension enforces the 1024px / 80% JPEG hard rule from `decisions.md` before bytes hit `dog.photo`. `RootView` extracts the routing: gate → if active dogs empty, AddDogView → Home; else Home directly. After save, the @Query on `RootView` re-evaluates and falls through to Home automatically — no callback plumbing needed.
- **DEBUG reset button on the gate.** Wipes Dog/Walk/WalkWindow with a confirmation dialog so the add-a-dog flow can be tested without rebuilding or app-deleting. `#if DEBUG` only.
- **Manual walk logging sheet** at `Features/WalkLog/LogWalkSheet.swift`. Tap "+" on Home (replaced the old ellipsis) → branded sheet: When (date/time picker), Duration (TextField + 5-min Stepper, range 1–300), Notes (optional). Cancel in toolbar, Save at bottom. `LogWalkFormState` is testable. Headline adapts to the active dog or to multi-dog ("Log a walk with Luna and Bruno."). Source = `.manual`, distance = nil.
- **Walk edit and delete.** Walk rows on Home are tappable → opens `LogWalkSheet` in edit mode (same form, pre-populated, navigation title flips to "Edit walk"). Save mutates in place; destructive Delete button at the bottom with confirmation dialog. `LogWalkFormState` gained `apply(to:)` and `from(walk:)` for the round-trip.
- **`StreakService`** at `Core/Services/StreakService.swift`. Pure function, no side effects. Replaced the hardcoded `14` on Home. Math per `decisions.md`: HIT day = ≥50% target; PARTIAL/MISS burn rest day; rolling 7-day window of the streak run allows ≤1 non-hit; days before `dog.createdAt` aren't penalised. Streak count = HIT days in the run. Initial test run flagged a real bug — my first interpretation checked the trailing 7 *calendar* days at any cursor, which penalised days before the user's actual streak started. Correct rule walks through *streak-run days only*. Rewrote the algorithm to track `nonHitDaysInRun: [Date]` and check window membership against that list. All tests now pass.
- **Code review pass.** Used `/swiftdata-pro` and `/swiftui-pro` skills against the schema and HomeView. Findings actioned: cached `DateFormatter` instances (avoid per-render allocation), 44pt tap targets on header buttons (HIG minimum), accessibility labels on icon-only buttons.
- **Doc updates.** `decisions.md` revised entries for "Apple Developer Program timing" (now: pay only at end-of-build, when ready to verify background wake) and added "Build sequence: passive walk detection ships last" decision. `architecture.md` folder-layout block matches Xcode's actual output (`ios/Trot/Trot.xcodeproj`); walk detection section flags end-of-build sequencing. Captured the Strava framing for manual-first development.
- **26 unit tests** total, all passing: 6 AddDogFormState, 7 LogWalkFormState (including `roundTripFromApply`), 13 StreakService.

**Committed this session:**
- `eba1f0b` — Add iOS skeleton: design system, gate, basic Home (45 files)
- `e8edc4d` — Defer passive walk detection to end of v1 build (decisions.md/architecture.md/log.md)
- `fda4ab8` — Add SwiftData schema (CloudKit-ready, local-only) and wire HomeView to live data
- `69d25fa` — Add the add-a-dog onboarding form
- `8f294e3` — Add DEBUG-only reset button on the gate
- `7c6e80c` — Add manual walk logging sheet
- `69abe4b` — Add StreakService and replace hardcoded 14 with real streak math
- `f7acad9` — Add walk row edit and delete
- All on `main`, pushed to `ElimDroflem/trot`.

**The app now functions end-to-end as a manual daily-walk tracker:**
1. Gate → reset (DEBUG) or continue → AddDog form (or Home if dog exists).
2. AddDog → fill in profile → Save → Home with real data.
3. Home shows dog name, today's progress (live from walks), streak count (live from `StreakService`), today's walk rows.
4. Tap "+" → log a walk → Home updates.
5. Tap a walk row → edit or delete → Home updates.

**Notable workflow note:** The first push of this session timed out with macOS `mmap` / "Stale NFS file handle" errors (likely iCloud Drive syncing the `Documents/` folder mid-push). `git repack -a -d` to consolidate loose objects fixed it. Pattern: if a future push hits the same error, run `git repack -a -d` and retry.

**Next session pickup:**
- **Activity tab calendar** (the next likely chunk): month view with day cells colour-coded by hit/partial/miss, prev/next month nav, monthly summary aggregates, tap a day → walks for that day. Replaces the current placeholder.
- After that, **Profile/Account tab** (edit dog, add another dog, archive, walk windows picker), then **LLM service** for personalised exercise targets, then notifications, then the missing-screens polish, then end-of-build (paid program, real auth, CloudKit turn-on, HealthKitService + walk detection algorithm).

**Open from this session that may surface later:**
- Real Luna photo source — still using a tinted placeholder. Corey to generate at some point.
- Production app icon — placeholder is in place.
- Sign in with Apple wiring — held to end of build.
- CloudKit sync — held to end of build.
- HealthKitService + walk detection — held to end of build.
- BreedData.json + breed-table-driven default target — currently every new dog gets `dailyTargetMinutes = 60`. Will be replaced when LLM service / breed-table lookup lands.
- Mixed-breed UI — current AddDog only collects `breedPrimary`. Secondary-breed collection is a polish pass when breed picker arrives.

## 2026-05-05 (evening) — iOS skeleton built and compiling

**Done this session:**
- Verified Xcode 26.4.1 installed (newer than the 26.3 minimum), `xcode-select` pointing at it.
- Created the Xcode project via the wizard: bundle id `dog.trot.Trot`, Personal Team for now, SwiftUI + SwiftData with "Host in CloudKit" ticked (auto-adds iCloud entitlement), Swift Testing system, save location `ios/Trot/Trot.xcodeproj`. Unticked Xcode's "Create Git repository" since the repo already exists at the root.
- **Option B taken on Sign in with Apple**: skeleton ships without the auth capability so we don't pay $99 yet. Placeholder gate (logo, headline, dimmed Sign in with Apple button, "Continue without sign-in" stub) is what users see at launch. Real auth lands when the Apple Developer Program is paid for.
- Set up the source folder structure under `ios/Trot/Trot/`: `App/`, `Features/{Onboarding,Home,Activity,Insights,Profile}/`, `Core/{DesignSystem,Models,Services,Extensions}/`, `Resources/Fonts/`. Project uses Xcode 16's `PBXFileSystemSynchronizedRootGroup` so files are auto-discovered — no `.pbxproj` editing needed when adding Swift files.
- Built the design system in `Core/DesignSystem/`: `BrandColor.swift` (semantic aliases only — Xcode 26 auto-generates `Color.brandPrimary` etc from asset-catalog colorsets, manual declarations would collide), `BrandFont.swift` (Bricolage display + SF Pro UI), `BrandTokens.swift` (`Space`, `Radius` enums), `BrandMotion.swift` (`brandDefault`/`brandCelebration` springs), `TrotLogo.swift` (wordmark with coral spot inside the `o`).
- 22 brand colorsets added to the asset catalog (light only). Bricolage `.ttf` files copied into `Resources/Fonts/`. `Info.plist` updated with `UIUserInterfaceStyle = Light` and `UIAppFonts`. Placeholder app icon (`app-icon-1024.png`) wired into `AppIcon.appiconset` — single universal entry, light only (Xcode warns about missing dark/tinted variants, accepted as placeholder).
- `OnboardingGateView` and a basic Outdoorsy + Grounded `HomeView` written. Home matches `snapshots/home.png` structurally: header with chevron + ellipsis, streak chip + date chip row, hero photo placeholder (tinted card with paw symbol — see Open below), "Luna's morning." progress card with rationale text, progress track in evergreen, "This morning" walks section with a confirmed walk row, branded TabView (Today/Activity/Insights/Luna).
- Stripped the wizard's SwiftData boilerplate: deleted `Item.swift` and `ContentView.swift`, simplified `TrotApp.swift` to a `@State` flag swapping between `OnboardingGateView` and `HomeView`. The real Dog/Walk/WalkWindow schema + CloudKit wiring stays deferred to its own plan-mode session per architecture.md ("Initial models. Refine in plan mode before implementing.") — half-doing it now would create migration debt.
- `architecture.md` folder-layout block updated to match Xcode's actual output (`ios/Trot/Trot.xcodeproj` rather than `ios/Trot.xcodeproj`). Decided that's cleaner than trying to fight Xcode's wrapper-folder convention.
- `xcodebuild build -scheme Trot -destination "platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17 Pro"` returns BUILD SUCCEEDED. Both Bricolage TTFs bundled in the .app, asset catalog compiled, app installable in simulator.

**Committed this session:**
- `eba1f0b` — Add iOS skeleton: design system, gate, basic Home (45 files, +1683/-19). Pushed to `origin/main`. First push timed out with macOS `mmap`/"Stale NFS file handle" errors (likely iCloud Drive syncing the `Documents/` folder mid-push); resolved with `git repack -a -d` to consolidate 158 loose objects into one 890 KiB pack, then push went through. If this recurs on future pushes, same fix.
- Mid-session decision shift, captured in `decisions.md`:
    - **Build sequence revised:** passive walk detection (HealthKitService, the algorithm, real-device testing) moves to the **end** of the v1 build, not the start. Manual walk logging is the primary v1-development path. Strava analogy — most fitness apps default to manual start anyway.
    - **Apple Developer Program timing revised:** $99 paid only at the very end, when ready to verify background walk-detection wake on a real device. Not at "first HealthKit work." Corey's framing: $99 acts as a risk gate, validate everything that can be validated on a free Personal Team first.
    - Caveat captured: pre-launch validation under manual-only logging is provisional — the friction of manual logging is part of what passive detection eliminates, so "I love it manually" is not a guarantee of "I love it automatically."

**Next session pickup:**
- **My recommendation:** SwiftData plan-mode session, local-only persistence (no CloudKit yet — that turns on with the paid program at the end). Refine the Dog / Walk / WalkWindow models per architecture.md, wire `ModelContainer` back into `TrotApp.swift`, replace HomeView's hardcoded constants with real `@Query` reads. Once data has somewhere to live, every feature after has a place to put it.
- **Then probably:** Add-a-dog onboarding form (the first feature that actually does something — collect profile fields, persist a `Dog`, navigate to Home with real data). After that, manual walk logging sheet, then build out the engagement loops (streak service, daily target scoring, weekly recap, insights).
- **Held to the end:** Sign in with Apple wiring, CloudKit sync turn-on, HealthKitService + walk detection algorithm, paid Apple Developer Program. All clean, well-defined swaps when we get there — no architectural rework needed.

**Open from this session that may surface later:**
- **Hero photo source.** Home currently shows a tinted placeholder card where the dog photo should go. The AI-generated `dog-luna.jpg` in `design-reference/Trot Design System/assets/` does not ship with the iOS app per `decisions.md`. Need to generate or commission a non-AI placeholder photo (or the proper user-upload flow) before this looks right. Action: Corey to generate this at some point — flagged here so it's not forgotten.
- **App icon production version.** Current icon in the asset catalog is `app-icon-1024.png` from design-reference, used as a placeholder. Needs replacement before TestFlight: generate via Claude Design (prompt drafted previously) and add proper light/dark/tinted variants per Apple's iOS 18+ icon system.
- **Sign in with Apple capability — held to end of build.** Disabled in the gate via Option B. When the Apple Developer Program is paid for at the end, add the capability via Xcode UI, swap the dimmed placeholder button for the real `SignInWithAppleButton`, wire `CKContainer.accountStatus()` for the iCloud-required gate.
- **CloudKit sync — held to end of build.** SwiftData will be wired local-only. The iCloud entitlement and CloudKit container array sit idle on the entitlements file until the end-of-build session that turns sync on (one `ModelConfiguration.cloudKitDatabase` flip plus CloudKit Console schema deploy).
- **Walk detection algorithm + HealthKitService — held to end of build** per the new sequencing. Constraints already locked in `decisions.md` survive intact.
- Breed-table verification pass — pre-launch task, all 30 entries flagged `needs verification`.

## 2026-05-05 — Foundation locked, skeleton blocked on Xcode install

**Done this session:**
- Pressure-tested the entire project plan via a structured grill (25+ findings: contradictions between docs, gaps, technical risks, design system integration). Worked through all of them.
- Locked decisions on auth (Sign in with Apple + iCloud required), LLM model (Haiku 4.5), failure UX (8s timeout, fall back to safe-range), streak mechanics (rolling-7-day, ≥50%, partial burns), notification times, distance source (HealthKit pedometer not breed-pace), iOS deployment target (18.0), photo storage (`.externalStorage` + downscale), force light mode, missing-screens strategy (build in code, don't pre-design), email service (Resend, swapped from MailerLite), repo (GitHub public), iOS CI (Xcode Cloud free).
- Path A confirmed for design system: `design-reference/Trot Design System/` is canonical. CSS leads, Swift mirrors. Trot Design skill installed project-scoped at `.claude/skills/trot-design/` (relative symlink).
- Home variant locked: Outdoorsy + Grounded. Other two variants deleted from `home-variants.jsx` and the kit's runtime toggle removed.
- Pre-code checklist mostly done: Bricolage Grotesque `.woff2` → `.ttf` conversion, app-icon-1024 placeholder rendered (Bricolage installed system-wide so Chrome could see it; production icon prompt still on Corey's list for Claude Design), Home variant snapshotted to `snapshots/home.png`.
- `docs/breed-table.md` populated with 30 UK breed YAML blocks (numbers grounded in PDSA puppy rule + KC tier categories + size/life-stage fallback). Every entry flagged `needs verification` — a single pre-launch verification pass replaces the TODO source URLs with real ones.
- All eight project docs updated to reflect the locked decisions. New `docs/breed-table.md` created.
- Two defaults taken without explicit ask, both flagged in decisions.md: deceased-dog v1 = 14-day no-walks safeguard, full memorialise UX deferred to v1.1; pre-Trot lifetime backfill = accept zero, "Trot starts counting today."
- Git initialised, `.gitignore` written, repo pushed to https://github.com/ElimDroflem/trot (commit `92d7b8e`).
- This session-log mechanism set up: `docs/log.md` (you're reading it) plus a pointer in `CLAUDE.md`. Not auto-loaded — read on demand when resuming work.

**Committed this session:**
- `92d7b8e` — Initial project setup: docs, brand, design system, decisions
- `7134ba7` — Add session log to docs/log.md, pointer in CLAUDE.md

**Blocked on:**
- **Xcode 26.3 not installed.** The Mac has Command Line Tools only (Swift 5.9, no `xcodebuild`, no simulator). Setup-guide Step 1 lists Xcode as a prerequisite but it was never verified. Corey is doing a system update + Xcode install during the next gap.

**Next session pickup:**
- Confirm `xcodebuild -version` reports Xcode 26.3+ and `sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer` has been run.
- Resume the iOS skeleton plan-mode session. Scope (per Corey's confirmed plan): Xcode project at `ios/Trot.xcodeproj`, folder structure per architecture.md, design system tokens mirroring `colors_and_type.css` 1:1 in `ios/Trot/Core/DesignSystem/`, asset catalog with brand colors (light only), Bricolage `.ttf` bundled in `ios/Trot/Resources/Fonts/`, Info.plist with `UIUserInterfaceStyle = Light` and `UIAppFonts` registered, Sign in with Apple gateway + iCloud-availability check (real native button, real `CKContainer.accountStatus()`), and the Outdoorsy Home matching `snapshots/home.png` at a basic level showing "Hello, Luna" via placeholder data.
- Decision needed at the top of next session: whether to autonomously generate the project via `xcodegen` (cleaner for LLM editing, brittle .pbxproj avoided) or have Corey create the Xcode project shell via Xcode UI (matches architecture.md's "use Xcode UI for capability changes" rule). My recommendation: Corey creates the shell via Xcode UI for the capabilities (Sign in with Apple + iCloud → CloudKit container creation), then I fill in everything inside. ~5 mins of UI clicks for him, the rest autonomous.

**Open from this session that may surface later:**
- App icon: production-quality version via Claude Design (prompt drafted, Corey to run when convenient). Current cream `app-icon-1024.png` is a placeholder — usable for skeleton dev, replace before TestFlight.
- Walk detection algorithm: still flagged Open in `decisions.md`. Dedicated plan-mode session before HealthKitService is built (constraints already captured: Core Motion primary, ≤3-min stationary tolerance, Apple Watch source filtering).
- Breed-table verification pass: pre-launch task. The numbers are conservative and structurally sound; verification replaces TODO sources with real URLs.
